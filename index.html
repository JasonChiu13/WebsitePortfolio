                <h3>Bio</h3>
                <p>Jason Chiu is a CSUF undergraduate student studying Computer Science
                    as his major. Despite nearing the end of his studying, he has trouble
                    deciding what he wants to do in the future. Hopefully, he finds his
                    true purpose in life without too much trouble.
